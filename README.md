My corpus is about the festival Pinkpop. I chose the playlist "Pinkpop 50 jaar", because it includes 500 songs played at the festival. I think it is an interesting topic, because it has a lot of different music genres, and artists. Personally I also like most of these genres.
I would like to compare the different genres of the festival. Most of the genres are pop music, but this can be divided in different categories. I think it is also interesting to see how the music changed from the early years of the festival until now. 
The festival also had a lot of artists. Some of them were only there once, and some of them came back very often. This is also interesting to research.
An a lot of musicians on the festival are Dutch, because it is a Dutch festival, but there are also a lot of international musicians. Is there a difference between them?

Almost all of the songs on the playlist are recorded, so the live performances could have been different from the recorded songs. Some of the performances had different musicians on it than in the original song, and some even added a whole orchestra. This could be a problem if I want to do a research about the musicians.
