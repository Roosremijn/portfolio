My corpus is about the festivals Pinkpop and Lowlands. I chose the playlist "Pinkpop 50 jaar", and Lowlands Best of. Both of the playlists have songs of all of the festival years. I think it is an interesting topic, because it has a lot of different music genres, and artists. Personally I also like most of these genres.
I would like to compare the different genres of the festival. Most of the genres are pop music, but this can be divided in different categories. I think it is also interesting to see how the music changed from the early years of the festival until now. 
The festivals also had a lot of artists. Some of them were only there once, and some of them came back very often. This is also interesting to research.
An a lot of musicians on the festival are Dutch, because they are Dutch festivals, but there are also a lot of international musicians.

Almost all of the songs on the playlist are recorded, so the live performances could have been different from the recorded songs. Some of the performances had different musicians on it than in the original song, and some even added a whole orchestra. This could be a problem if I want to do a research about the musicians.
It could also be hard to compare the playlist because one of the playlists is older than the other. Pinkpop exists 50 years and Lowlands 27.
